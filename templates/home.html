  <p>Endpoint: /api/detect_mask</p>
  <p>POST Request Body (JSON):</p>
  <pre>
{
  img: string value; base 64 encoded image,
  find_face: boolean value; set this to true if image is not already cropped to face, default: false
}
  </pre>
  <p>Response (JSON):</p>
  <pre>
{
  is_wearing_mask: boolean value; whether the person in the image is wearing a mask,
  face_found: boolean value; only present if find_face was true, indicates whether a face was detected,
  error: string value; only present if an error occurred, provides error details
}
  </pre>
  <p>For best results, crop image to face first and then call the API endpoint with find_face = false. There are many existing face detection systems in existence already, so this system does not seek to improve upon those. If find_face is set to true, Haar cascade classifiers from OpenCV will be used for face detection.</p>
  <p>The mask detection model is a convolutional neural network which was trained for 1.3 million passes on a dataset of 10,000 examples (before data augmentation). The model achieved 99%+ accuracy and F1 score on the test set (and train and dev sets).</p>
